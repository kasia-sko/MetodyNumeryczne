## Numerical Methods

In this repository, you can find two individual projects carried out during the third semester (winter 2024/2025) at WUT. The repository contains both code and reports (in Polish). The projects were implemented using **MATLAB**.

### Simpson's Method for Approximating the Value of an Integral

Simpson's method used to calculate the approximate value of the integral $$\int_a^b \omega_n(x) \, dx$$, where $$\omega_n$$ is given by:

$$
\omega_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k \left( T_k(x) + U_k(x) \right)
$$

### Gauss-Seidel Method

The Gauss-Seidel method used to solve matrix equations of the form $$AX = B$$ and $$XA = B$$, where $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$$, $$B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$$ or $$B \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$$.
